Accessibility

Orbix is designed to support a wide range of learners by providing personalized learning experiences. While we are continuously improving our platform, full accessibility support is not yet available.

We currently focus on clear interfaces, flexible learning formats (text, audio, video, and interactive content), and compatibility with major web browsers. However, some advanced accessibility features — such as complete screen-reader optimization and full keyboard navigation — are still in development.

Accessibility is a priority in our product roadmap. We are actively working to expand compliance and ensure that every user can benefit from Orbix, regardless of their needs or learning conditions.

If you have feedback or specific accessibility requirements, our team will be happy to collaborate and support improvement.
