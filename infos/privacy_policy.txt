Orbix respects the privacy of institutions, educators, and students. All data stored in the platform is collected solely to support the learning experience and to enable core functionality such as personalized study routes, performance analytics, and account management.

We do not sell, share, or commercialize personal data with third parties. Access to information is strictly controlled by user roles, ensuring that personal and institutional data is only viewed by authorized users.

All content uploaded into Orbix — including documents, routes, and educational materials — remains under the ownership of the institution and is never shared across different institutions within the platform.

Orbix processes content in a secure environment and uses it exclusively to generate learning experiences validated by the institution’s educators.
